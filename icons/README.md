# Explaina Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Creating Icons

You can create your own icons using any image editor. The icons should:

- Be square (same width and height)
- Have a transparent background
- Use the extension's color scheme (purple gradient: #667eea to #764ba2)
- Be clear and recognizable at small sizes

## Icon Design Suggestions

- Use a brain or AI symbol (ðŸ¤–)
- Include the letter "E" for Explaina
- Use a modern, clean design
- Ensure good contrast for visibility

## Temporary Icons

For now, you can use any placeholder images or create simple colored squares as temporary icons until you design the final ones.

## Icon Formats

- PNG format is recommended for transparency support
- JPG can be used if transparency isn't needed
- SVG is not supported by Chrome extensions
